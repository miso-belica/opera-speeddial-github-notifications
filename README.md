# GitHub notifications (dead)

Opera extension that displays unread notifications on GitHub in Speed Dial.

There is another extension for Opera
at https://github.com/sindresorhus/GitHub-Notifier
but I prefer Octocat in Speed Dial.

# Why the project is dead
Unfortunately Opera decided to not support Speed-Dial extensions because it was hard and time consuming (at least that's what they wrote all the maintainers).

> We would like to inform you that Speed Dial extensions are now in the End-Of-Life. Some time ago we have limited and now ended support for Speed Dial extensions. We encourage you to rewrite your extensions so that they use other forms of presenting information, e.g., browser actions, popups, notifications or sidebars.

I use this as a replacement: https://github.com/tanmayrajani/notifications-preview-github
